The highest number which could be expressed with
convenience in this notation was 9999111 1113 9999ιΙΙ my-
riad3 in other words no number which would require
more than lorty thousand ligures iu the modern notation
could be denoted by it. The extension 01 the system by
Archimedes is not open 10 this objection. The principle
adopted by him is the same as that 01 Apollonius3 but
instead 01 regarding the normal Greek system as con-
sisting 01 two 13113113 each containing lour versae, he

treated itas an 031311 containing eight versus The num·
bers ol' this octad were called πρῶτοι ἀριθμοί; the highest
numbcr 01 the epoto: ἀριθμοί was 99999999. The next higher
number 101 was taken 33 1113111111 01 1113 δεύτεροι ἀριθμοί 31111

311 «second numbers» were regarded as multiples ol l0⁸;
similarly other octadswere added in successi0n‚ the third
containing multiples 01 10103 the 11111 031311 multiples 01
10899. Let us now write in the notation 01 Α1311111131133
the numbers already multiplied in the notatiou 01 Apol-
lenius:

9><1091ε9><105><101631111300><10’6; thus both
belong 10 the third octad; their pythntencS, as bel'ore.
are 9 31111 3, their versus 99 (;0-1- 9 ><8); and 19
(ῑ9-1-9><8); hence the versus 01 1113 product is

99-1- 19- 1 ε10, the 1331 versus 01 1113111111031311;

accordingly the product is 111 πέμπτων ἀριθμῶν. lu pratice all

that is necessary is 10 multiply the numbers without re·

gard 10 the octads‚ and determine the octad 011113 product

by subtracting l from the sum 01 the octads ol the lactors:
