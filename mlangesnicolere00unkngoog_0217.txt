«384. Three pieces ol a Greek papyrus. From Das·
hour. n catalogue, p. 29.

Two other papyri in the Abbott Collection may be men·
tioned. One (No, 65) is a large pieee, inscribed on the
recto in a coarse demotie hand, and lolded small. The
verso is occupied by Greek documents, written in rapid
cursivo hands of the Roman peri0d¹. As there was no
opportunity to dampen the papyrus, and as it could not
be safely handled without dampening, an extended exa-
mination could not be made. Nos. 373 and 374, again,
are large Egyptian papyri, with a single line of Greek,
apparently a dooket of some sort, at the foot ol the
columns:

Ἔτους θ Tulli ᾗ. . . . . . . . .. δι’ Ἡρακλεῶου ,
