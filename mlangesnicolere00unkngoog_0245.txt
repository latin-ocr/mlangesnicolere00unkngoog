like the bottom ol a τ. But there is no known variant and
i is not impossible.

436. προσοισ[ε7ις; l. προσοίσει. The mistake was no doubt
due to the similarity ol lines 440 und 444.

437. ξυναρπαζει7ς]ἱ συναρπάσει ΟΡ συναρπᾶσῃ MSS. The future
is necessary, but the active form which the space in the
papyrus indicates may be right. The o in ξυν is corrected
lrom a, and the o of the preceeding ου has a thin horizon-

tal stroke through the top which at lirst sight gives the ,

letter the appearance ol σ; but 0 was probably intended.

438. aasabim: κάνύσαντε Mss, no doubt correctly.

441. σθ’ ; ’στιν Mss.. as is required by the rnetre.

444. ln προσοισεις some correction which it is dislicult to
explain seem to have been made by a later hand. lmine·
diately alter the lirst σ there is asmall hole in the papy-
rus above which is what looks like the top ol a superscri-
hed α, while where thei should be there is a large and
thick blot.

447. lt is not easy to reconcile the vestiges of letters

here with the accepted text, ol τᾶρα νὴ τὴν Ταυροπόλον. νη could

be read, but then there is hardly roorn lor ει rapx, which in
lines 435, 439 and 443 occupies considerably more space.
But the writing varies a good deal in size and may have
got smaller just at this point.

470. Aparagraphns below this line is probably lost in
thelacuna.

474. rotor: l. τοῖς.
. 472. δέ must be read alter εαν with the Mss.

mittigat: i. e. κοιλιδιᾱν, which is also the reading (lor κυλοι-
διῖω) of the llavenna manuscript.

473. &eloi ‘y' ωςί deici ’γὼ lllSS.‚ rightly. l. oulplpovog.

475. ayn-nai is a naistake lor σφηιιωι.
