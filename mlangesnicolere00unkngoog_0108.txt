rather than of infant baptism is contemplated, and se-
condly the N. Τ. texts are often cited in an archaic form,
lor example at John 8⁸⁸ the author had the reading sicut
ctiam pater ciue, answering to the older Greek text καθὼς
καὶ ὁπατὴρ αὐτοῦ.

Thirdly the dogmatic appreciation of the Baptism ol
lesus is almost Ebionitc in tone. lt is regarded as the oc·
casion of his spiritual illuminatior, when u all the sulness
of the godhead was pleased to dwell bodily in him; not
piecemeal as in other saints, not according to measure,
but in plenitude and perpetuity. r Only ol the Spirit ol the
Lord, the Spirit ol wisdom which then took possession of
lesus, is true what is written in lohn's Gospel, that all
things were made by it and without it was nothing made.
lts advent constituted lesus tha Elector chosen one of
God.

The above argument is developed in illustration os the
Roman rite of confirmation, when the ssishop seals the
person baptised with the chrism and communicates to
him the holy Spirit. The entire passage begins on fol. 54
and is as follows:

Nam presbiteris siue absentibus siue praesentibus epis-

copis baptizare et baptizatos crismate ungere licet, sed
quod ab episcopo fuerit consecratum, nec tamen frontem,
ex e0 de¹ oleo signare licet, quod solis episcopis debetur
cum tradant spiritum paraclitum, qui spiritus paraclitus
septiformis etiam gratia dicitur, propter septenarii nu-
meri misterium in quo summa perfectio intelligitur. Est

enim compositus ex toto primo pari et ex toto primo im-
pari. Ex toto primo pari qui diuidi potest, et ex toto

¹ de seems superfluous. The ms. has a compendium, viz. d with the vertical
stroke barred, which should perhaps be read as dicto.
