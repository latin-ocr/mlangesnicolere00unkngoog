'rba promam in Theon is ω divide (ιω ÷ g -l- 33.) by
(25 ἦ» g -Ι- ὲ-εὴ, or. in Greek notamina. ιο divide Ἀφα κ’ ιε’
by η ,β’ .’; every step os the process ἰε sully described
hy him in words and it is too long to quote here. but n·
we translate {he words into symbols we obtain the follow-

ing scheme. which contains every operation described by
Theon :

Ἀφιι κἰι” uui-ni El'Aqanoen'w': §lq-u‘lopn' ιε’

This result 6ιοΟ 7' ΒΨ is u little too large: but it is given
by Theon as the nearest second [o the required result.
12 is easy to see that. as sar as the notation is conam-ned.
there is nothing to prevent a considerable abbreviation
of the process by combining the steps in threes, thus:

Ἀφιε κ’ [εΗ ι, κε ιβ’ ὅ( ἐπὶ ξ] Ἀφιβ x'n 71' ιε”βρῆἰεη

Another example taken srorn Theon, who in this case
merely states the result without giving the steps, is dis-

cussed by Hultsch in Pauly-wissowa, 11, 107¹ Γ. The
problem is to divide 7424 seconds by {340 -ί- 8 minutam
