(Voss.) alveari aad, ἀλλὰ βασανιστέον. ἀνεκτοί was emended by
Dobree to ἀνεκτέα, which has found favour with Subsequent
editors. The same metrical result is effected by the posi-
tion assigned in the papyrus to ἐτ’, which however produces
an irregularity in the first foot. p of yalp ist not certain, but
the vestiges suit quite well; there is not room for more
than four letters in the preceding lacuna.

480. οτι conlapsum ποτε is a little long for the lacuna which
is of the same size as in the preceding and following lines
and would accordingly be sufficiently fitted by 12-14 let·
ters, lt is therefore quite possible that in the papyrus
version there was no discrepancy with the antistrophe,
where according to the text of the Mss. the correspon-
ding line (544) is a foot shorter than line 480. Enger's
conjecture however, ἐπὶ τῷ ποτε, would be too short for the
space.
