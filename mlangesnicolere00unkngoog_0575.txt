phantus sor the multiplicatiou of fractions, by which he
would immediately hnow the rank or versus ol the pro-

duct: e. g. yrirabeg ἐπὶ χιλιάδας γίνονται μυριαῧων tamenab& thou-
sands multiplied by thousands produce hundreds of

myriads‚ 'B ἐπὶ ’Δ l ll :- two thousand by four thousand
produces eight hundred myriads; or χιλιάδες ἐπὶ δεκάδας γίνονται

μυριάδες, ’Β ἐπὶ pllll. ln cases ol doubt or hesitation there
was a very simple rule which corresponded to the modern
practice ol counting the zeros: the number of the versus
ol aproduct isone less than tho sum ol' the numbers of
the versus ol the two sactors Though within the octad
this rule was probably applied unconsciously, it becomes
of great importauce when wc have to deal with very
high numbers, as will become evident when we consider
the extensions ol' the system proposed byslpollonius and
Archimedes. As an instance we may suppose that it is
required to find the product ol σ and T. The πυθμένες, im-
mediately suggested by διακόσιοι and τρισχίλιοι, arel and 3;
their productilis the πυθμήν ol' the product: the numbers
of the versus are 3 and 4, hence the uersus ol the produnt

is 3254- l 26, and the result is at once written

down lli.

The following examples ol multiplicatiori should now
be intelligible without further explanation:
