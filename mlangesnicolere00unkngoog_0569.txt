from 1 to 9; those ol⁴ the second row teus (Bmffieg) from 10
109ος those ofthe third hundreds (ἑκατοντάδες) from 100 to
900 and those of the fourth thousands (χιλιάδες) from 1000
lo 9000. The fourth row is a repetition οἱ the first, the
symbols being disterentiated hy a large eur-ved flourish at
the top. which makes them very prominent in papyrus

Before proceeding to explain the system by which
higher numbers were expressetl by the Greeks it will be
