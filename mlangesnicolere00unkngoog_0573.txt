corresponding multiples 01 ten under each other, and it ’
will be seen that it is as easy to add horizontally as verti-
cally; horizontal addition is indeed much less difficolt in
the Greek than in the modern notation. The eye runs
along the line picking out all the numbers ol the first
reisue, which are added mentally3 the result is then writ-
ten down, and the same process is repeated with the
numbers 01 the second and third uersus in succession: il
at any ol the steps there is anything to be carried on it
may be either written down immediately or carried on
mentally. Supposing‚ lor instance, that we wish to find
the sum ol 4:321, 2107 and 10811, the process in Greek nota·
tion would be 'Arva’Bpt’Arrll'Zpit As the eye runs along
the line it sees in succession the numbers 01 the first versus
αζθ, which are mentally added together giving ιζ; ζ is writ-
ten down and then the numbers 01 the second versus ικπ
are added giving p23 ι is written down and in the same
way pap] φ and ’A’B’As’z are obtained. The process is thus
quite as easy and as rapid as the modern method‚ it re-
quires no previous arrangement 01 the numbers and it
occupies less space. Here is an example involving l'rac-
