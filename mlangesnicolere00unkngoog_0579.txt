Hultsch supposes that the dividend was reduced to attalo
«third sixtieths» and the divisor to 8048 minutes, and
then the process is reduced to the division ol integers.
This method‚ no doubt, gives the correct result, but ma-
kes much ol what Theon has said as to the division ol
sexagesimal lractions superfluous and involves us in some
dilliculty with the remainder. ll we remember Theon's
rule that the result ol dividing seconds by integers is in
seconde, there is no difficulty in performing the operation

Ι hope that it has now been sufficiently demonstrated
that, to one who has made himself familiar with the Greek
symbols, the notation in itsell present no obstacles‚ and
, that it is easy to use and compact in expression. As
already indicated however it is only adapted lor numbers
less than one hundred millions. ln order to facilitate the
multiplication ol very large numbers Archimedes and
Apollonios ol Perga extended the original Greek system,
each in a dillerent manner; it is a misconception to sup-
pose that either ol these mathematicians introduced a
completely new notation‚ lor both ol them accepted the
existing system as it stood, and neither (lid anything more
than expand it hy analogy. Thus Archimedes Aren„ Ill,
introduces his theory with the words: —- συμβαίνει δὴ τὰ
ὀνόματα τῶν ἀριθμῶν ἐς τὸμὲν τῶν μυρίων ὑπάρχειν ἁμῖν παραδεδομένα,
καὶ ὑπὲρ τὸ τῶν μυρίων αποχρεὸντως ἐμμιγνώσκομες μνριαῧων ἀριθμὸν lsyo'v· Ι

Apollonius regarded the existing system as consisting
