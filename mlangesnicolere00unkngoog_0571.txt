the myriads and sometimes a mere point was used, thus
the highest number ol this complete system could bewrit·

ten down as wi 'Omna or 'tapqt Μυ '0qu or 'Opqt
0qu representing 9999 myriads -Ι- 9999ε99,999,999.
ln this way tbe Greeks could express by symbols any
number less than a hundred millionS‚ which is quite
sullicient lor all the practical purposes ol lil'e3 and hence
perhaps we may understand why it was that in nations
which used this system ol notation‚ the next highest
number« ten thousand times ten thousand» was used to
represent a multitude which no man could number, as in

to expansion by analogy2 but tbe consideration ol the

expansions proposed by Archimedes and Apollonius ol
Perga must be postponed till wc have (liscussed the pro-
cess of multiplication.

When numbers were written in connexion with words
they were osten distinguished lrom the latter by a hori-
zontal line drawn above them, ’ρῖδ z tat. ln the course
ol time this line was written with an upward inllection‚
so that it came to present tbe appearance ol an accent in
the l'orm generally given in modern texts. This careless
method of writing is inconvenient in the extreme, as it
leads to great confusion between integers and fractions
ln purely arithmetical operations the distinguishing line
was unnecessary and accordingly was generally omitted.

The space at my disposal does not permit me to discuss
sully the treatment of fractions; but since they occur in
some ol tbe examples which l shall have to quote, l shall
