assumption that nothing is lost before Θε]μιστοκλ’ in Ι. l, but
the length of the lacuna at the ends of lines is quite uncer-
tain. ln l. 2 alteranpa is an obliterated letter. ln l. 3the
first three letters and the final ςοΐαυθεντης are very doubtful.

ll. Aristophaneo, Lysr'strettet.

ln this fragment, which also comes from a papyrus
book, are preserved more or less completely some thirty
verses of Aristophanes' Lysr‘strata (lines 433-447, 469-484),
written, like l, in a goodsized clear cursive hand which
we should assign to the end of the fourth or the first half
of the fifth century. Changes of speaker are denoted by
double dots or paragraphi, sometimes both (line 438);
marks of elision are frequent, but no breathings or ac-
cents occur. A sec-ond hand seems to have made an alte-
ration in line 444. The common use of iota adscript may
suggest that this copy was not far removed from a much
older manuscript, but the quality of the text is not high.
The most interesting part is the chorus in lines 476 sqq„

where however the papyrus unfortunately becomes very
fragmentary. lts measurcments are 10 >< lot· cm.

Recto.
