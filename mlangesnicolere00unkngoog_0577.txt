translations ol each step because Hero has obscured the
process by the introduction ol many unneccssary words

and the omission of explanatory symbols.

Divtcion. The only extant example ol division in which
the steps ol thc process are described is contained in
Theon's commentary upon Ptolemy; it occurs in a treatise
devoted to the explanation ol' the treatment ol' sexagesi-
mal fractione, in which a knowledge ol the logistic of
integers is assumed. l shall, therefore, first give an
example ol the division ol integers according to the me-
thod which l believe to bave been employed by Greek
arithmeticians. Suppose that it is required to divide 889
by 24. the process would, in my opinion, bave been writ-
ten down thus: — oattab ἐπὶ λβψωρξθυέπὶ ζΙρξηῆαβλζ
ἐλάσσω α.

lt is obvious that the first multiple ol 24 must be 30;
then 24><3027⁶2Q subtract lrom 889, the remainder
is 1693 the next ligure ol the quotient is seen to be 7,
24><7= 168 the result is 37 and there is a remainder l.
